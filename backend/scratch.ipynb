    "- blog\n",
    "  - I'm using the artifacts to make custom documentation just for your question\n",
    "    - You can jump over and see what the LLM saw by scrolling down through\n",
    "  - Find a short llmtxt\n",
    "  - \"What constitutes good docs that you can do this with?\" Good section titles, good section opening text, nesting/organization makes sense \n",
    "  - benefits \n",
    "    - much smaller number of tokens than the whole doc (figure out how much smaller!) (more tokens than semantic search)\n",
    "    - can see all of the documentation (b/c you have all the headings) - so if the docs are well organized, then it's easier to find the right thing\n",
    "  - Is it perfect?\n",
    "    - Doesn't close things well\n",
    "    - real test is to ask it something you know it should answer\n",
    "    - If the docs are poorly organized or titled, then it might never find anything\n",
    "    - Lots of requests with large documents.\n",
    " - Best question ot ask \"Make me a document that tells me what this service is and create a simple tutorial of how to use it.\" - this is probably good for the saved blog post thing\n",
    " - blog post; show it putting up pieces of the website\n",
    " - connect to https://www.linkedin.com/in/msrickard/\n",
